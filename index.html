            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am 29 years old and a specialist in Surgery and Traumatology. Currently, I am seeking opportunities 
                and learning in the field of web development (front-end developer). Living in Brazil, but open to the 
                world and possibilities.
            </p>
            <h2>What Inspired My Career Change?</h2>
            <p>
                The job market, the daily routine, the chance to have different experiences, 
                the contact with technology and development, the opportunity to create and change the world with technology, 
                and the desire to step out of stagnation and my comfort zone.
            </p>
